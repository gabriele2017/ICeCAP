INSTALL
********


Make sure that, as in the manual, all dependencies are satisfied at the command line, e.g. bowtie2, GNU scientific libraries and recent version of Perl should be available at the command line prompt.

Please refer to the manual for an introduction to dependencies required. 

To compile and use ICecap just type, at the command line, in the ICeCap folder:

%make + enter.

This will generate the binary you will run in your shell script (refer to the ICeCAP_stage1/2.sh shell scripts and read the manual, including the list of optional ICeCap arguments).
